# Convolutional-Neural-Networks

The repository contains applications of concolutional neural networks to computer vision problems on python that trains from the dataset and executes the algorithm . The algorithm learns using a stochastic gradient descent to speed up learning. Convulation functions and pooling functions are added in a fully connected neural network for better accuracy .
